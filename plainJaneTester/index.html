            Whether you are just entering your new found hobby, a veteran or somewhere in between it is important to employ safety as a principle rule when operating firearms.

          <span class='bold'>Rule One:</span>
          <span class='italic'>
            Guns should ALWAYS be treated as if they are loaded. (Even when they are not!)
            This is an important guideline which naturally assists you with applying all other rules.  Even after you have checked to see if your firearm is unloaded, never do anything that we would not do with a loaded gun.

        <div class='ruleDesc'>
          <span class='bold'>Rule Two:</span>
          <span class='italic'>
            Under no circumstance should you point your gun at anything you are not willing to destroy.
            No matter what we are doing with our firearms, ALWAYS keep it pointed in a safe direction.  Whether we are unloading it, cleaning it or just showing it to a friend, we never allow the muzzle to point at anything that we don’t want to put a hole in or anyone that you are not willing to kill.
            This should be applied at all times while handling a firearm no matter the circumstance.
          </span>

        <div class='ruleDesc'>
          <span class='bold'>Rule Three:</span>
          <span class='italic'>
            Never have your finger on the trigger until your sights are on target and you have made a decision to shoot.
            When you operate a firearm, you should always be aware of your finger placement. A safe, trained shooter never, ever finds any of his fingers seated on the trigger or within the trigger guard if they didn’t make the conscious decision to place it there.
            Your fingers should rest safely, indexed high on the frame of your firearm until you have deliberately made the decision to engage a target.
          </span>
        </div>
        <div class='ruleDesc'>
          <span class='bold'>Rule Four:</span>
          <span class='italic'>
            See your target and what is beyond it.
            Every shooter is responsible for where their bullets land.  Just as important as it is to identify your target, we must also know what surrounds it.  It is important for every shooter to consider where your bullets may land if you miss your target.
            Whether we are at the range, hunting outdoors or self-defense, we should be conscious of the type and power of the firearm we are shooting, our target and what potentially may be hit once we have fired.
